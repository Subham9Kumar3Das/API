    "While \"API\" is a general term for any set of rules that allows software components to communicate, \"Web API\" specifically refers to APIs accessible over the web. All Web APIs are APIs, but not all APIs are necessarily Web APIs. Web APIs often use HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and are commonly used in web development for data exchange between servers and clients."
